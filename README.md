# Hand-Tracking Fruit Ninja: A MediaPipe + ECS Implementation in React

## About the Project

This project is a webcam-driven reimplementation of the classic Fruit Ninja game that combines MediaPipe Hands-based gesture recognition with a custom Entity Component System (ECS) architecture built in TypeScript and React. Players interact with the game using natural hand gestures captured through their webcam—specifically, pinch gestures between thumb and index finger—to slice flying fruits while avoiding bombs. The system eliminates the need for traditional input devices like mice or keyboards, providing an immersive, touchless gaming experience. The implementation features real-time hand tracking at 45-60 FPS, adaptive difficulty scaling over a two-minute progression curve, physics-based fruit trajectories with type-specific gravity, and a modular ECS design that separates movement, collision detection, rendering, and disposal systems. Built entirely with modern web technologies (React 19, Vite, HTML5 Canvas, MediaPipe), the game demonstrates how commodity computer-vision pipelines can be integrated into browser-based applications to create natural user interfaces without requiring specialized hardware beyond a standard webcam.
